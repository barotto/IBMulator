/* There's some confusion about the proper terminology.

 * like 2011 and 2121.
 * "Model" was the combination of machine "Type" with a variation, e.g. 2121-A82,
 * which identified a particular hardware configuration.
 * Unfortunately IBM later started to use "Model" to identify the machine "Type"
 * as well, like it used to do with the PS/2 line.
 * I use Type in the sense IBM originally intended.

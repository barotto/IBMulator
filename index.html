<a href="#top"><h2 id="about">About</h2></a>
<img src="media/ps1_love.png" style="float:right; padding: 0 0 1em 1em;" />
<p>
IBMulator is a free/libre and open source PC emulator focused on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/1">IBM PS/1</a> line of computers, 
able to run with the original ROM.
</p>
<p>
The goal is not just to develop yet another emulator, but also to create a faithful <b>simulator</b> with the look and feel of the real machines, drive sounds included.
</p>

<p>
IBMulator can emulate the following systems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM PS/1 model 2011 (80286 @ 10MHz)</li>
<li>IBM PS/1 model 2121 (80386SX @ 16MHz ~ 20MHz)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The program is still in active development so expect bugs and missing features.
</p>

<a href="#top"><h2 id="features">Features</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>Works with the original IBM ROM.<br />IBM's peculiar 4-quad GUI and BASIC programming environment included!</li>
<li>PS/1 and AdLib audio cards emulation.<br />The 8-bit DAC and Programmable Sound Generator with 3 voices plus noise of the <a href="https://ps1stuff.wordpress.com/games/">PS/1 Audio Card</a> is properly supported. The <a href="http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=YM3812">Yamaha YM3812</a> (aka OPL2) is also present in its <a href="http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=AdLib">AdLib</a> incarnation.</li>
<li>HDD and floppy emulation.<br />You can use standard floppy and HDD images in LBA format. The IBM's HDD 8-bit RLL proprietary interface is also emulated, so no additional IDE roms workarounds are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Sound effects.</strong><br />Emulation of the working noises generated by the floppy drive, the HDD, and the system unit fans.</li>
<li>Realistic timings.<br />The 286 and 386 CPUs, the WDL-330P HDD, and the integrated VGA are as painfully slow as in the original machine, for the truest PS/1 experience. The Prefetch Queue is also emulated, so games like JetFighter work as expected.</li>
<li>OpenGL video output with shaders.<br />The video output can be manipulated with standard GLSL shaders; included is the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsjSzR">CRT shader by Timothy Lottes</a></li>
<li>DSP filters.<br />Audio channels can be filtered with DSP filters like Low Pass and High Pass (and many others), so that the PC-Speaker can be reproduced as it was originally intended, in all its lo-fi glory.</li>
<li>State recording and resuming.</li>
<li>Screenshots, audio WAV capture, and VGM dumping.<br />When an audio recording is started, music data from the PS/1 and AdLib audio cards is also saved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGM_%28file_format%29">VGM format.</a></li>
<li>Full OpenGL GUI.<br />Triple mode of operation: compact (a la DOSBox), normal (w/ the system unit), and realistic (whole system, monitor included!), for an added sense of realism.</li>
<li>Debugging tools.</li>
<li>Multithreaded.<br />Video rendering, sound rendering, and CPU core emulation are on separate threads, so your multi-core beast has some spare cycles for overclocking that puny 286.</li>
<li>Highly configurable.<br />You can create a dream PS/1 configuration, with 500MB HDD, 16MB RAM and a blazingly fast 40MHz 386 CPU, if you want to.</li>
<li>Multiplatform.<br />Runs in Windows and Linux, 64-bit only though because this is the 21st century.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Currently missing features that I wish to implement, some day ...</h3>
<ul>
<li>MIDI output with redirection to an external sound module (like a real MT-32.)</li>
<li>Comprehensive configuration GUI and multiple save state support.</li>
<li>Emulation for Sound Blaster audio and NE2000 network cards.</li>
<li>Video capture.</li>
<li>3D VR interface.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#top"><h2 id="usage">Usage</h2></a>
<h3>TL;DR version</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ibm+ps%2F1+rom+images">Obtain</a> a ROM set</li>
<li>Launch the program</li>
<li>Edit ibmulator.ini and specify the ROM set name</li>
<li>Relaunch and enjoy</li>
</ol>
<h3>Full version</h3>
<p>
Please see the <a href="https://github.com/barotto/IBMulator/blob/master/README.md">README</a> file included in the package for detailed instructions on how to configure and use the program.
</p>

<h3>Supported ROMs</h3>
<p>
This is the list of supported ROM BIOS versions and the default configurations that IBMulator selects when it loads them.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the P/N and MD5 values refer only to the 64K BIOS code part of the ROM, loaded at offset 0xFF0000. The additional part with the BASIC interpreter and the ROM drive is not taken into consideration. IBMulator uses the computed MD5 value only to select the actual hardware configuration to use for the "auto" values in the ini file. 
</p>
<p>
IBM used the same ROM BIOS for multiple 2011 / 2121 models and the system configurations reported here and selected by IBMulator are just for your convenience. Every aspect of them can be overridden using the ibmulator.ini file.

<h3>HDD types</h3>
<p>These are the HDD types supported by the PS/1 BIOS.<br />This table was defined by IBM and is common to many of the their products of the same era. While rendered irrelevant with the introduction of the ATA interface in the 2121 model, it's still present in its BIOS and it can be used in IBMulator to quickly specify a geometry and create a pre-formatted disk.</p>

</pre>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> "type 47" is an IBMulator only feature, as the original BIOS does not have an interface to define a custom geometry.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> the biggest formattable HDD you can define (type 47) for model 2011 is 496MiB (CHS 1024/16/62), due to a BIOS bug that limits the sectors per track to 62 instead of 63. The fact that such a bug exists is unsurprising as back then no HDD had 63 physical sectors per track.

<a href="#top"><h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2></a>

For the current list of known bugs please see the <a href="https://github.com/barotto/IBMulator/issues">GitHub's issue tracker</a>.

<dl>

<dt>Where am I supposed to put the ROM and what should I write in the ini file?</dt>
<dd>The easiest way is to put the ROM inside the same folder of ibmulator.ini and write its filename in the [system] section. 
If you want to put the ROM somewhere else then write its full path in the ini file.</dd>


<dt>I can't seem to manually navigate to my disk images on the D: drive, from the floppy file explorer. What now?</dt>
<dd>
Unfortunately IBMulator is still incomplete and on Windows the floppy image file dialog can't move from a drive partition letter to another.<br />
You have two options: 
<ol>
<li>put the full path of your disk images directory in the media_dir ini file setting, under the [program] section</li>
<li>use the value "native" in the [program]:file_dialogs ini file setting.</li>
</ol>
As to why IBMulator can't do something so basic as to navigate to a different drive letter, please consider that I'm a Linux developer and on Linux there's no such thing as a "drive letter" ;)
</dd>


<dt>My Windows OS is in Italian/Greek/%other-non-US-language% and IBMulator won't start. What can I do?</dt>
<dd>
The current version of IBMulator won't work if you launch it from a file system path with non-ASCII charachers in it. This is a <a href="https://github.com/barotto/IBMulator/issues/43">known bug</a>. Put the IBMulator package on C:\ or D:\ or wherever you want as long as there are no non-ASCII characters in its full path.
</dd>



<dt>What kind of shaders can I use? What kind of extension? i.e. are .glsl and .fx supported?</dt>
<dd>
You can use one of the shaders available in the share/ibmulator/gui/shaders directory. At the moment there are only 2 possible options:

<ul>
<li>use the default shaders (the ones initially set in the ini file), which do simple image scaling;
<li>use the fb-scanlines.fs fragment shader, which is the CRT styled scan-line shader by Timothy Lottes.
</ul>

The scaling quality is also determined by the *_filter options. So suppose you want to use the scanline shader:
<pre>normal_shader=gui/shaders/fb-scanlines.fs</pre>
This will apply the scanline shader for the normal and compact GUI modes only.
<br />
If you are an expert GLSL programmer you can create one youself starting from the default shaders. Shaders from other emulators are not directly usable but could, at least in theory, be adapted.
</dd>


<dt>In order to play Monkey Island, do I have to create an .img file with all the files of the game?</dt>
<dd>
IBMulator is not simply an emulator (like DOSBox is), it's also a simulator, so it operates using disk images, for both the HDD and floppy disks.

In order to play a game:
<ol>
<li>prepare an HDD image: download a premade one or create a new one. If you decide for the latter, IBMulator will create an empty new disk image for you; you'll have to then install DOS using the DOS install floppy images or you can restore the original IBM software from a restore floppy disk set.
<li>install the game you want to play from its floppy images into the HDD. You can also copy a game's files directly on the HDD's .img using special software capable of manipulating image files: on Linux this is relatively easy, look at the "HDD image" section of the <a href="https://github.com/barotto/IBMulator/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.
</ol>
Using floppy images can (and should) be done through the GUI: click on the floppy drive and a selection window will appear, pointing to the media directory where the floppy images should be located (the default media directory can be set in the ini file under the [program] section).
So at the end of the day, using IBMulator is like using a real IBM PS/1 computer. Sometimes it's incovenient, just like the real thing!
</dd>


<dt>I use the 2121 BIOS but the 4-quad GUI doesn't show up like in the 2011 model. Instead, a "Non system-disk or disk error. Press Enter" message appears after memory test. What do I have to do?</dt>
<dd>
The PS/1 2011 has a so-called romdrive in the ROM image, with PC-DOS and the 4-quad software in it. The 2121 has 2 versions of the ROM, one with the romdrive and one without. You need to use the 386/16 version of the ROM which has the romdrive built in, or, if you want to use the 386/20 version, you need a HDD image with the IBM's original PS/1 software installed.
</dd>


<dt>There are already plenty of emulators. Why another one?</dt>
<dd>
Why not? Most of the time a FOSS project starts by scratching a developer's personal itch. I had several itches, like: 

<ol>
<li>At the time (early 2014), nobody was interested in emulating the PS/1 and its audio card.</li>
<li>I was looking for a new free time software project.</li>
<li>I wanted to learn something new (C++11, multithreading, x86 assembly, PC architecture.)</li>
<li>I always wanted to write an emulator.</li>
</ol>

</dd>


<dt>Why didn't you contribute to MESS / PCem / %EmulatorName% instead?</dt>
<dd>
I did think about it, but ended up voting against. Working in an existing environment has its own rather steep learning curve and I'm not an emulation and/or PC architecture expert, nor a C/C++ professional. Actually, because of my lack of experience, I end up incorporating lots of code from other license-compatible projects (open source be praised).

<dt>Why the IBM PS/1, an overpriced, slow PC compatible that was already absolete at launch?</dt>
<dd>
Nostalgia. The PS/1 has been my very first PC when I was a child, so I wanted to make it immortal before the machine I still have dies of old age.<br />
Also I think that it has some dinstinctive features that make it interesting an unique, like the 4-Quad ROM SHELL interface.

<dt>Can I contribute?</dt>
<dd>
Sure! See below for contact information.

<dt>Can I reuse your code for %EmulatorName%?</dt>
<dd>
Yes, as long as you abide by the GPL's terms and conditions. Also, feel free to contact me for information about the PS/1 and its inner workings.
